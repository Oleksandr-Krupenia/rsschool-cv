## About Myself

I’m a third-year student of Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics. I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Full-Stack Web Developer.
